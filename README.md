# Bootcamp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

The Prework project was the first step in learning about Frontend Development in order to begin a new career as a developer.

This project was designed to introduce the core concepts of web development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with notes on how these core technologies work togther to produce a website or web appliction. Also covered was the importance of developing a growth mindset for learning these new skills.

The project helped with understanding the core development tools required such as a text editor (VSCode), Version Control (Git) and hosting code in the cloud (Github) to allow code versions to be securely stored, colaboration with others and deploying the website through Github Pages

This entire process helped achieve a basic understading of the web technologies and tools required and how they all work together to produce a website that can be deployed on the internet.
